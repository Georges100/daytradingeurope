Day trading in Europe for 5 major stocks compared to a long-term shareholder.

I wanted to investigate the trends on day trading in 5 of the most prominent stocks in Europe during the months of November and December: Airbus, L’Oreal, Deutsche Bank, BNP and Volkswagen. I’ve colledted live data by the second thanks to hopey.nt. Those two months were particularly good for these stock so I might as well repeat my own experiment in less positive trends.

I’ve compared the performance of a regular shareholed who keeps the stock till the end of our period to those of a day trader who sticks to his own rules. The rules will apply to when and how a trader will enter the market and his exit (via stop loss or sell by the end of the day).

During my first round, I’ve applied these strategies:

Common to all strategies: If there is no stop loss, I will sell my stock between 17:00 and 17:30. For this, I’ve used an average of the prices during this half hour.

Keep Benchmark: For this, I’ve assumed I’ve bought the stock at the opening price of the first day of my data and sold it at the closing price. In case of days missing, I’ll have sold my stock the day before at the closing price.

First series: There will be a stop loss from 14:00 whenever the stock loses 100 points to the opening price.

A) I will enter the market between 9:10 and 10:00 when the stock has gained at least 50 points relative to the opening price (ask price). There will be a stop loss from 14:00 whenever the stock loses 100 points to the opening price.

B) I will enter the market between 9:10 and 10:00 whenever the stock has surged at least 50 points except when the stock is over 100 points. There will be a stop loss from 14:00 whenever the stock loses 100 points to the opening price.

C) I will enter the market between 9:10 and 10:00 whenever the stock has surged at least 50 points. I will trigger the sale of my stock if the price is over 200 points after 14:00.

D) I will enter the market between 9:10 and 10:00 whenever the stock has surged at least 50 points except when the stock is over 100 points. I will trigger the sale of my stock if the price is over 200 points after 14:00.

Second Series: There will be a stop loss from 10:00 whenever the stock loses 100 points to the opening price.

E) I will enter the market between 9:10 and 10:00 when the stock has gained at least 50 points relative to the opening price (ask price). There will be a stop loss from 10:00 whenever the stock loses 100 points to the opening price.

F) I will enter the market between 9:10 and 10:00 whenever the stock has surged at least 50 points except when the stock is over 100 points. There will be a stop loss from 10:00 whenever the stock loses 100 points to the opening price.

G) I will enter the market between 9:10 and 10:00 whenever the stock has surged at least 50 points. I will trigger the sale of my stock if the price is over 200 points after 10:00.

H) I will enter the market between 9:10 and 10:00 whenever the stock has surged at least 50 points except when the stock is over 100 points. I will trigger the sale of my stock if the price is over 200 points after 10:00.
